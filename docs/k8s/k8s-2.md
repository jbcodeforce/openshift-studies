# Security

With kubernetes deployed internally, companies have control over their physical environment, network, operating system patches,
 access to authentication and authorization internal registry. They control data access, access to administration console 
 for the platform and the workload deployed.

As part of security is the Identity and Access Management to control access to resource and connection protocol 
like [OpenID](https://openid.net/what-is-openid). A team is a logical grouping of resources, users, and user groups. 
Teams can be restricted to all resources within a namespace.  Access control gateway enforces role-based access control
 (RBAC) for all registered services.

Network segmentation to provide isolation, using DMZ VLAN for specific workload, so deploying cluster in DMZ. 
And use VLAN to segment the physical network, subnets, clusters and namespaces to add more segmentation.

Segmentation will depend of the application requirements.

For securing kubernetes network control, you will have Edge nodes that are worker nodes with only ingress workloads 
and network policies.  Traffic reaches application through private network. Backend services may not be accessible 
from public network. K8s [network policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) 
specifies how pods can communicate with each other, and [Calico](https://www.projectcalico.org/), the IP based networking, 
implements the policies (rule per IP addresses). Rules are ORe'ed, if any ingress / egress rule matches connection is allowed. 
Their are scoped at namespace level.

We can isolate application using labels. The `srv1` backend can be accessed only from the frontend

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: backend-allow
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: Srv1
      Tier: backend
  ingress:
  - from:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: Srv1
            Tier: frontend

```

and the db backend can only be accessed from the `srv1` backend.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: db-allow
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: Srv1
      Tier: db
  ingress:
  - from:
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: Srv1
            Tier: backend

```

## Role Based Access Control

Add a user to a role:

```sh
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user strimzi-cluster-operator-namespaced IAM#emailasuserid@something.com
```

## Security Context Constraints

* Security Context Constraints (SCCs) to control permissions a pod can perform and what resources it can access
* Access to existing SCC: `kubectl get scc`
* Get security policies for a scc: `oc describe  scc privileged`
* You can specify SCCs as resources that are handled by RBAC. This allows you to scope access to your SCCs to a certain project or to the entire cluster. Assigning users, groups, or service accounts directly to an SCC retains cluster-wide scope
